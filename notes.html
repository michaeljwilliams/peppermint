pep: HTML within JavaScript
mint: JavaScript within HTML

{{; ;}} pep
    • js with html in it. Parsed for html, compiled into js, then eval()'d
    • eg: {{; foo = <p>hello</p> ;}}
    • angle brackets and contents are converted to template literals
        - pep.foo(` is inserted before opening tag
        - )` is inserted after closing tag

{{ }} 
    • html with js expressions in template literal format
    • eg: <p>${foo}</p>
    • The contents will be converted into a template literal in a statement that adds it to the result.
    • eg: <p>${foo}</p> will be converted into someFunc(`<p>${foo}</p>`);

engine exposes variables for convenience
    • sitewide variables: site.foo
    • file variables: filepath.foo (current page or other page)
        - relative: 'path/to/file.html'
        - absolute (from site root) '/path/to/file.html'

Note that this won't compile correctly in pep. A newline or space is required between }} in pep.
