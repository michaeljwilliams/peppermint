to-do:

- readme link to gulp-peppermint
- require() passed to evaluated code should automatically add process.cwd() to path
- includes accept references for path, context, and options
- toSrc for includes
- async includes
- client-side includes
- includes: make parent context and current context both available at once
- error handling
- lint parsed html and js before evaluating, for better error handling ?
- docs
- evaluate html expression without being in a js split
- escape sequence handling
- split regex: negated lookahead for escape sequence
- split regex: try character sets instead (probably faster)
- escaped html
+ synchronous server/static includes
