TO-DO

- accept and output multiple files in vinyl format
- evaluate and compile all files at once??? (another level of arrays)
- error handling
- lint parsed html and js before evaluating, for better error handling
- docs
- evaluate html expression without being in a js split
- split regex: negated lookahead for escape sequence
- escape sequence handling
- split regex: try character sets instead (probably faster)
- includes (async fetch and compilation)
- escaped html
