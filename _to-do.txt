to-do:

- includes (async fetch and compilation)
- use JSON.parse instead of new Function?
- async include options
- error handling
- lint parsed html and js before evaluating, for better error handling ?
- docs
- evaluate html expression without being in a js split
- escape sequence handling
- split regex: negated lookahead for escape sequence
- split regex: try character sets instead (probably faster)
- escaped html
